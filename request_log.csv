## [Considerations]:
1. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
2. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
3. We can adapt to the coming changes.
4. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
5. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
6. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
7. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
8. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
9. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
10. I care about the planet.
11. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
12. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
13. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
14. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
15. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
16. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
17. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
18. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
19. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
20. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
21. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
22. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
23. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
24. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
25. The response to climate change is not going to be positive. The same mistakes will keep happening.
26. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
27. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
28. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
29. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
30. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
31. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
32. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.

21. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.

30. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.

## [Considerations]:
1. The response to climate change is not going to be positive. The same mistakes will keep happening.
2. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
3. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
4. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
5. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
6. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
7. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
8. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
9. We can adapt to the coming changes.
10. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
12. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
13. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
14. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
15. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
16. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
17. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
18. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
19. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
20. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
21. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
22. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
23. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
24. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
25. I care about the planet.
26. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
27. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
28. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
29. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
30. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
31. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
32. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
33. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.","1. 9
