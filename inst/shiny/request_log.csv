## [Considerations]:
1. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
2. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
3. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
4. I'm always cynical about government processes.
5. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
6. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
7. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
8. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
9. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
10. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
11. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
12. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
13. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
14. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
15. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
16. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
17. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
18. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
19. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
22. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
23. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
24. We are a democratic country.
25. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
26. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
27. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
28. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
29. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
30. People get the government they deserve
31. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
32. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
35. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
36. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
39. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
40. We live in a great democracy.
41. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
42. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
43. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
45. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
46. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.","1. 11

10. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
11. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
12. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
13. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
14. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
15. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
16. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
17. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.

22. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
23. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
24. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
25. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
26. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
27. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.

31. We are a democratic country.
32. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
33. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

35. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
39. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
40. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
41. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
42. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
43. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
2. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
3. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
4. I'm always cynical about government processes.
5. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
8. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
9. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
10. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
11. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
12. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
13. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
14. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
15. We are a democratic country.
16. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
17. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
18. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
19. People get the government they deserve
20. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
21. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
22. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
23. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
24. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
25. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
26. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
27. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
28. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
29. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
30. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
31. We live in a great democracy.
32. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
33. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
34. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
35. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
36. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
41. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
42. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
43. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
46. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
47. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
48. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
2. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
3. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
4. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
5. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
6. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
7. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
8. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
9. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
10. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
11. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
12. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
15. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
16. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
17. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
18. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
19. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
20. We live in a great democracy.
21. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
22. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
23. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
24. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
25. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
26. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
29. We are a democratic country.
30. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
31. People get the government they deserve
32. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
33. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
34. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
35. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
36. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
37. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
39. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
40. I'm always cynical about government processes.
41. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
42. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
43. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
46. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
47. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
48. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.","1. 1
