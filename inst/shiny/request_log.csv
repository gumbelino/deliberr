## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
2. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
4. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
5. People get the government they deserve
6. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
7. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
8. We are a democratic country.
9. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
10. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
11. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
12. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
13. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
14. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
17. We live in a great democracy.
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
20. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
21. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
26. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
27. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
28. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
29. I'm always cynical about government processes.
30. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
33. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
34. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
35. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
36. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
37. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
41. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
42. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
43. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
46. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.","1. 11

10. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
11. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
12. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
13. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.

15. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.

24. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
25. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.

## [Considerations]:
1. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
2. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
5. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
6. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
7. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
8. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
9. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
12. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
13. We are a democratic country.
14. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
15. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
16. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
17. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
18. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
19. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
20. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
21. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
24. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
25. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
26. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
29. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
30. We live in a great democracy.
31. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
32. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
33. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
34. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
35. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
36. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
37. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
38. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
39. People get the government they deserve
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
45. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
46. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
47. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
48. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
2. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
3. I'm always cynical about government processes.
4. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
5. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
6. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
7. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
8. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
9. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
10. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
11. We live in a great democracy.
12. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
18. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
19. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
20. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
21. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
22. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
23. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
24. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
25. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
26. We are a democratic country.
27. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
28. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
29. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
30. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
32. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
33. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
34. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
35. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
36. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
39. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
40. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
41. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
42. People get the government they deserve
43. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
44. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
47. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
48. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.","1. 11

6. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
7. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
8. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
9. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
10. People get the government they deserve
11. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
12. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
13. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
14. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
15. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
16. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
17. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
22. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
23. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
24. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
25. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
26. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
29. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
30. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
31. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
32. We are a democratic country.
33. I'm always cynical about government processes.
34. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
35. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
36. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
37. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
38. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.

41. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
42. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
43. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
44. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
45. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
48. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.","1. 1

1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
3. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
4. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
5. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
6. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
7. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
8. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
9. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
10. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
11. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
14. I'm always cynical about government processes.
15. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
16. People get the government they deserve
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. We live in a great democracy.
19. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
20. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
21. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
22. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
23. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
24. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
25. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
26. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
27. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
28. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
29. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.

31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
32. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
33. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
34. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
35. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
36. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
37. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
38. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
41. We are a democratic country.
42. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
43. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
44. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
45. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
2. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
3. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
4. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
5. We are a democratic country.
6. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
7. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
9. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
12. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
13. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
14. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
15. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
16. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
17. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
18. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. People get the government they deserve
21. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
22. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
23. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
24. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
28. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
29. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
30. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
31. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
32. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
33. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
34. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
42. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
43. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
46. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
47. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.

## [Considerations]:
1. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
2. I'm always cynical about government processes.
3. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
4. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
5. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
6. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
7. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
8. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
9. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
10. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
11. We live in a great democracy.
12. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
13. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
18. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
19. We are a democratic country.
20. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
21. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
22. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
23. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
24. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
25. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
26. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
27. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
28. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
29. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
30. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
31. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
32. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
33. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
34. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. People get the government they deserve
37. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
38. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
39. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
40. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
41. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
42. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
43. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
44. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
45. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
46. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
47. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
48. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
2. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
3. We live in a great democracy.
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
6. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
7. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
8. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
9. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
10. People get the government they deserve
11. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
12. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
13. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
14. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
15. I'm always cynical about government processes.
16. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
17. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
18. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
19. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
20. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
21. We are a democratic country.
22. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
23. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
24. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
27. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
28. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
29. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
30. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
31. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
32. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
33. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
36. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
37. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
38. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
39. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
42. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
43. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
44. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
45. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
46. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
47. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

## [Considerations]:
1. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
2. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
4. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
5. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
6. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
7. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
8. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
9. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
10. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
11. We live in a great democracy.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
14. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
15. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
16. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
17. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
18. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
19. People get the government they deserve
20. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
21. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
22. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
23. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
24. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
25. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
26. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
27. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
28. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
29. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
33. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
34. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
35. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
36. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
39. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
42. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
43. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
44. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.

## [Considerations]:
1. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
2. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
3. We live in a great democracy.
4. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
5. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
6. People get the government they deserve
7. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
8. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
9. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
10. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
11. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
12. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
14. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
15. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
18. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
19. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
20. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
21. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
22. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
23. We are a democratic country.
24. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
25. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
26. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
27. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
28. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
29. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
30. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
31. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
32. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
34. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
37. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
38. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
39. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
40. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
41. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
44. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
45. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
46. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
47. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
2. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
3. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
4. We are a democratic country.
5. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
6. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
7. People get the government they deserve
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
9. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
10. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
11. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
12. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
13. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
14. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
15. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
19. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
20. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
21. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
22. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
23. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
26. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
27. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
30. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
31. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
32. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
33. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
34. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
35. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
36. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
45. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
46. I'm always cynical about government processes.
47. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
48. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.","1. 11

12. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
13. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
14. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
15. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
16. We live in a great democracy.
17. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
18. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
19. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
20. I'm always cynical about government processes.
21. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
22. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
23. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
24. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
25. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
26. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
27. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
28. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
29. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
30. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
31. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
32. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
33. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
34. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
35. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
36. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
37. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
38. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
39. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
40. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
41. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
42. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
43. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
44. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
45. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
46. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

## [Considerations]:
1. We live in a great democracy.
2. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
3. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
4. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
5. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
6. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
7. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
10. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
11. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
12. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
13. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
16. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
17. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
18. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
19. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
20. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
21. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
22. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
23. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
24. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
25. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
28. We are a democratic country.
29. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
30. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
31. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
32. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
33. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
34. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
35. I'm always cynical about government processes.
36. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
39. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
40. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
41. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
42. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
43. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
44. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
45. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
46. People get the government they deserve
47. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
48. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
2. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
3. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
4. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
5. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
6. People get the government they deserve
7. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
8. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
9. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
10. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
11. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
12. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
13. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
14. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
15. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
16. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
17. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
18. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
19. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
20. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
21. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
22. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
23. I'm always cynical about government processes.
24. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
25. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
26. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
27. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
28. We are a democratic country.
29. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
30. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
31. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
32. We live in a great democracy.
33. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
34. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
35. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
36. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
37. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
38. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
39. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
42. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
43. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
44. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
45. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
46. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
47. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
48. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.","1. 1

12. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
15. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
16. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
17. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
20. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
21. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
26. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
27. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
28. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
29. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
30. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
31. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
32. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
33. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
34. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
35. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
38. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. I'm always cynical about government processes.
44. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

36. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
37. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
38. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
39. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
40. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
41. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
42. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
45. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
46. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 2
