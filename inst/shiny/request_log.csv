## [Considerations]:
1. I'm always cynical about government processes.
2. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
4. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
7. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
8. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
9. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
10. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
11. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
12. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
13. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
22. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
23. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. People get the government they deserve
26. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
27. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
28. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
29. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
30. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
33. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
34. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
38. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
43. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
46. We live in a great democracy.
47. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
48. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.","1. 11

14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
17. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
20. I'm always cynical about government processes.
21. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
26. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
28. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
29. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
30. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
31. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
32. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
33. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
34. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
35. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
36. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
39. We are a democratic country.
40. People get the government they deserve
41. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
47. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
48. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.","1. 1

10. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

14. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
2. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
6. We can adapt to the coming changes.
7. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
8. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
14. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
18. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
19. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
24. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
25. I care about the planet.
26. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
29. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
30. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
31. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
32. The response to climate change is not going to be positive. The same mistakes will keep happening.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
2. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
3. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
4. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
8. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
13. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. I care about the planet.
20. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
21. We can adapt to the coming changes.
22. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
23. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. The response to climate change is not going to be positive. The same mistakes will keep happening.
25. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
26. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
29. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
30. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
31. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.

## [Considerations]:
1. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
4. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
5. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
6. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
7. I'm always cynical about government processes.
8. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
11. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
12. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
13. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
20. We are a democratic country.
21. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
22. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
23. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
26. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
27. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
28. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
29. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
30. People get the government they deserve
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
33. We live in a great democracy.
34. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
35. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
36. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
37. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
38. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
39. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
43. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
44. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
45. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
6. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
7. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
10. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
11. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
15. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
16. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
18. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
19. People get the government they deserve
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
22. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
23. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
24. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
25. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
28. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
32. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
33. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
34. We live in a great democracy.
35. We are a democratic country.
36. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
39. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
43. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
44. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
45. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market","1. 1

13. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
14. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

16. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

20. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
21. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
22. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
23. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
24. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
25. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
26. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
27. We are a democratic country.
28. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
37. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
42. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.

46. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.

3. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
4. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
5. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
6. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.

9. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
10. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
11. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.

13. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
14. People get the government they deserve
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.

21. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
22. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
23. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
24. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
25. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
26. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.

## [Considerations]:
1. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
2. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
3. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
4. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
7. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
8. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
9. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
10. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
11. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
12. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
13. We live in a great democracy.
14. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
15. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
18. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
19. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
20. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
21. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
22. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
23. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
24. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
25. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
26. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
29. We are a democratic country.
30. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
31. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
32. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
33. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
34. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
35. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
36. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
37. I'm always cynical about government processes.
38. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
39. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
40. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
41. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
42. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
43. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
44. People get the government they deserve
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
2. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
3. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
4. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
5. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
6. We live in a great democracy.
7. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
8. We are a democratic country.
9. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
10. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
11. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
12. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
13. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
14. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
15. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
16. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
17. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
18. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
19. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
22. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
23. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
24. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
25. I'm always cynical about government processes.
26. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
29. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
30. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
31. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
32. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
33. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
34. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
35. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
36. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
39. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
42. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
43. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
46. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
47. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
48. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.","1. 8

11. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
13. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.

15. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
16. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

18. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.

29. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
30. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
31. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
32. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
33. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
34. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
35. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say

## [Considerations]:
1. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
2. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
3. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
4. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
5. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
6. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
7. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
8. We live in a great democracy.
9. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
10. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
11. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
12. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
13. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
14. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
16. We are a democratic country.
17. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
18. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
19. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
20. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
21. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
22. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
23. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
24. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
25. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
26. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
27. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
28. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
29. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
30. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
31. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
32. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
35. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
36. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
37. People get the government they deserve
38. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
39. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
40. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
41. I'm always cynical about government processes.
42. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
43. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
46. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.

## [Considerations]:
1. We are a democratic country.
2. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
3. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
4. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
5. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
6. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
7. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
8. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
9. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
10. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
11. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
12. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
13. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
14. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
15. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
16. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
17. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
18. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
19. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
22. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
23. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
24. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
25. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
26. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
28. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
29. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
30. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
33. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
34. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
35. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
36. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
37. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
38. People get the government they deserve
39. We live in a great democracy.
40. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
41. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
42. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
43. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
44. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
45. I'm always cynical about government processes.
46. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
47. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
48. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
2. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
3. I'm always cynical about government processes.
4. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
5. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
6. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
7. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
8. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
11. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
13. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
16. We live in a great democracy.
17. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
18. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
19. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
20. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
21. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
22. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
23. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
24. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
25. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
26. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
27. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
28. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
29. People get the government they deserve
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
32. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
33. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
34. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
35. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
36. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
37. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
38. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
39. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
44. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
45. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
46. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
47. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
48. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.","1. 3

1. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
4. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
5. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
6. People get the government they deserve
7. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
8. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
9. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
10. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
11. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
12. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
13. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
14. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
15. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
18. I'm always cynical about government processes.
19. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
20. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
21. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
22. We live in a great democracy.
23. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
24. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
25. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
28. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
29. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
30. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
31. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
34. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
35. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
36. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
38. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
39. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
40. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
44. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
45. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
46. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.

## [Considerations]:
1. People get the government they deserve
2. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
3. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
4. We are a democratic country.
5. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
6. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
7. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
8. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
9. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
10. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
11. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
12. We live in a great democracy.
13. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
14. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
15. I'm always cynical about government processes.
16. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
17. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
18. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
19. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
20. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
21. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
22. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
23. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
24. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
25. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
26. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
27. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
28. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
29. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
30. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
31. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
32. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
33. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
34. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
35. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
36. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
37. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
38. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
39. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
42. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
43. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
44. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
45. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
46. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
48. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
2. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
3. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
4. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
5. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
6. I'm always cynical about government processes.
7. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
8. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
9. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
10. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
11. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
12. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
13. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
14. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
15. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
16. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
17. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
18. We are a democratic country.
19. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
20. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
21. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
22. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
23. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
24. People get the government they deserve
25. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
26. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
27. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
28. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
29. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
30. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
31. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
32. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
33. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
34. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
35. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
36. We live in a great democracy.
37. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
38. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
39. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
40. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
43. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
44. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
45. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
46. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
47. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
48. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.","1. 11

11. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
13. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
14. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
15. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
16. People get the government they deserve
17. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
18. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
22. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
23. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
24. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
25. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
26. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
27. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
28. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
29. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
30. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
31. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
32. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
33. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
34. We live in a great democracy.
35. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
36. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
37. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
38. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
39. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
40. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
41. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
42. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
43. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
44. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
45. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
46. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
47. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
48. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.","1. 1

3. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
4. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
7. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
8. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
9. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
10. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
11. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
12. I'm always cynical about government processes.
13. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
14. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
17. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
18. People get the government they deserve
19. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
20. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
21. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
22. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
23. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
24. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
25. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
26. We live in a great democracy.
27. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
28. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
29. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
30. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
31. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
34. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
35. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
36. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
39. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
40. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
41. We are a democratic country.
42. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
43. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
44. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
45. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
46. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
47. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.

## [Considerations]:
1. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
2. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
3. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
6. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
7. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
8. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
9. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
10. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
11. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
12. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
13. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
18. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
19. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
20. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
21. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
22. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
23. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
24. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
25. People get the government they deserve
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
28. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
29. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
30. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
31. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
32. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
33. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
34. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
37. We live in a great democracy.
38. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
39. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
40. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
41. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
42. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
43. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
44. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
45. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
46. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
47. I'm always cynical about government processes.
48. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
2. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
3. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
4. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
5. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
6. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
7. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
8. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
9. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
10. People get the government they deserve
11. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
12. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
13. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
14. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
17. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
20. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
21. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
22. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
23. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
26. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
29. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
30. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
31. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
32. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
33. We are a democratic country.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
36. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
37. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. I'm always cynical about government processes.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
46. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
47. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
48. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.","1. 11

16. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
19. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
20. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
21. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
22. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
23. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
24. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
25. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
26. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
27. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
28. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
29. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
32. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
33. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
36. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
37. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
38. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
39. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
40. We are a democratic country.
41. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
42. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
43. We live in a great democracy.
44. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
45. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
46. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
47. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
48. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.","1. 4

1. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
2. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
5. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
6. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
7. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
8. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
9. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
10. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
11. We live in a great democracy.
12. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
15. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
16. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
17. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
18. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
19. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
20. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
21. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
22. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
23. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
24. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
25. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
26. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
27. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
28. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
29. We are a democratic country.
30. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
31. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
32. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
33. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
34. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
35. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
37. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
38. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
39. I'm always cynical about government processes.
40. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
41. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
42. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
43. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
44. People get the government they deserve
45. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.

## [Considerations]:
1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
3. We live in a great democracy.
4. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
5. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
6. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
7. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
8. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
9. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
10. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
11. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
12. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
13. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
14. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
15. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
16. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
17. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
18. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
19. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
20. People get the government they deserve
21. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
22. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
23. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
24. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
25. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
28. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
29. We are a democratic country.
30. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
31. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
32. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
33. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
34. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
35. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
36. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
37. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
38. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
39. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
42. I'm always cynical about government processes.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
45. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
46. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
47. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
48. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
2. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
3. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
4. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
6. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
7. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
8. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
9. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
10. I'm always cynical about government processes.
11. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
12. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
13. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
14. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
15. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
20. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
21. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
22. We are a democratic country.
23. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
24. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
25. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
26. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
27. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
28. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
29. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
30. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
31. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
32. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
33. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
34. People get the government they deserve
35. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
36. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
38. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
39. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
40. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
41. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
42. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
43. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
44. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
47. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
48. We live in a great democracy.","1. 8

19. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
20. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
21. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
22. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.

24. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
25. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
26. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
27. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
28. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
29. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
30. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
31. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
32. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
33. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
34. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
35. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
36. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
37. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
38. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
39. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
44. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
45. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
46. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
47. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
48. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.","1. 2

## [Considerations]:
1. I'm always cynical about government processes.
2. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
3. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
4. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
5. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
6. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
9. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
10. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
11. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
12. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
13. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
18. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
19. People get the government they deserve
20. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
21. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
22. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
23. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. We are a democratic country.
26. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
27. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
28. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
29. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
30. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
31. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
32. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
33. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
34. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
35. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
36. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
37. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
38. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
39. We live in a great democracy.
40. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
41. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
42. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
43. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
44. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
45. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
46. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
47. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.

## [Considerations]:
1. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
2. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
3. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
4. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
5. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
6. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
7. People get the government they deserve
8. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
9. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
10. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
11. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
12. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
13. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
14. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
15. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
16. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
17. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
18. We live in a great democracy.
19. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
22. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
23. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
24. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
25. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
26. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
27. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
28. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
29. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
30. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
31. I'm always cynical about government processes.
32. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
33. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
34. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
35. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
39. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
40. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
41. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
44. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
45. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
46. We are a democratic country.
47. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
48. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.","1. 8

## [Considerations]:
1. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
2. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
3. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
4. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
5. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
7. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
8. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
9. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
10. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
11. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
12. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
13. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
14. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
15. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
18. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
19. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. I'm always cynical about government processes.
22. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
23. We live in a great democracy.
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
26. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
27. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
28. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
29. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
30. People get the government they deserve
31. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
32. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
33. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
34. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
35. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
38. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
39. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
40. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
41. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
44. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
45. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
46. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
47. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
48. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
2. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
3. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
4. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
5. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
6. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
9. I'm always cynical about government processes.
10. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
11. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
12. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
13. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
14. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
17. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
18. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
19. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
20. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
21. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
22. People get the government they deserve
23. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
24. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
25. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
26. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
27. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
28. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
29. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
30. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
31. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
32. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
33. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
34. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
39. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
40. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
41. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
42. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
43. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
44. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
45. We are a democratic country.
46. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.

## [Considerations]:
1. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
2. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
3. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
4. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
5. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
7. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
8. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
9. People get the government they deserve
10. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
11. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
12. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
13. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
14. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
15. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
20. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
21. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
22. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
23. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
24. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
25. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
26. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
27. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
28. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
29. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
30. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
31. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
34. We live in a great democracy.
35. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
36. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
37. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
38. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
39. I'm always cynical about government processes.
40. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
41. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
42. We are a democratic country.
43. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
44. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
45. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
46. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
47. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
48. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
2. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
3. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
4. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
5. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
7. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
8. We live in a great democracy.
9. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
10. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
11. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
14. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
17. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
18. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
19. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
20. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
21. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
22. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
23. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
24. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
25. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
26. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
27. I'm always cynical about government processes.
28. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
31. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
32. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
33. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
34. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
35. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
36. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
38. We are a democratic country.
39. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
40. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
41. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
42. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
43. People get the government they deserve
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
45. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
46. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
47. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
48. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. A more transparent healthcare system would help people understand costs and make better decisions.
2. The Swiss healthcare system focuses too much on treating diseases rather than on disease prevention to improve public health.
3. It is important to involve more private actors in healthcare (e.g., outsourcing administrative tasks in hospitals to specialized companies) to reduce costs.
4. Abolishing mandatory health insurance would reduce the financial burden on households.
5. A more centralized healthcare system, such as national hospital planning, would better organize and improve efficiency in healthcare.
6. Limiting the influence of private insurance companies in the Swiss healthcare system would help avoid higher costs without improving the quality of care.
7. Higher tax deductions for medical expenses would help households manage healthcare costs more effectively.
8. As health insurance premiums rise, more households require financial assistance, such as individual premium subsidies, to afford coverage.
9. Government control of drug prices would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging excessive prices.
10. Less government regulation in health insurance would allow for more competitive pricing.
11. Switzerland currently has a 'two-tier' healthcare system, where wealthier individuals receive better healthcare than others.
12. Reducing the scope of mandatory health insurance coverage could help lower overall healthcare costs.
13. A lack of financial support for preventive measures leads to higher healthcare costs in the long run.
14. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and simplifying administrative processes in healthcare could lead to significant cost savings.
15. The current system encourages excessive use of services once the deductible ('franchise') has been paid, leading to unnecessary treatments and higher overall costs.
16. Health insurance costs should be income-based to make them more affordable for lower-income individuals.","1. 7

## [Considerations]:
1. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
2. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
3. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
4. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
5. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
6. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
7. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
8. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
9. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
10. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
11. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
12. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
13. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
14. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
15. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
16. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
17. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
18. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
19. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
20. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
21. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
22. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
23. People get the government they deserve
24. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
25. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
26. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
27. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
28. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
29. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
30. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
31. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
32. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
33. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
34. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
35. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
36. I'm always cynical about government processes.
37. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
38. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
39. We live in a great democracy.
40. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
41. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
42. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
43. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
46. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
47. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.

## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
2. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
3. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
4. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
5. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
6. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
7. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. I'm always cynical about government processes.
10. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
11. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
12. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
13. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
14. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
15. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
16. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
17. We are a democratic country.
18. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
19. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
20. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
22. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
23. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
24. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
25. People get the government they deserve
26. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
27. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
28. We live in a great democracy.
29. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
30. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
31. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
32. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
33. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
34. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
35. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
36. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
37. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
38. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
39. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
40. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
41. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
42. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
43. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
44. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
45. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
46. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.","1. 1

## [Considerations]:
1. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
2. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
3. People get the government they deserve
4. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
5. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
6. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
7. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
8. We live in a great democracy.
9. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
10. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
11. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
14. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
15. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
16. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
17. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
18. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
19. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
20. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
21. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
22. I'm always cynical about government processes.
23. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
24. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
25. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
26. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
27. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
28. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
31. We are a democratic country.
32. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
33. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
34. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
35. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
36. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
37. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
38. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
39. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
40. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
43. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
44. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
47. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
48. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
2. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
3. We are a democratic country.
4. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
5. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
6. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
7. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
8. I'm always cynical about government processes.
9. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
10. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
11. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
12. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
13. We live in a great democracy.
14. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
15. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
16. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
17. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
18. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
19. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
20. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
21. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
22. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
23. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
24. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
25. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
26. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
27. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
28. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
29. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
30. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
31. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
32. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
33. People get the government they deserve
34. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
35. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
36. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
37. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
38. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
39. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
42. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
43. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
44. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
45. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
48. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.","1. 1
