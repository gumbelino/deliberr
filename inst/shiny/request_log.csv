## [Considerations]:
1. I'm always cynical about government processes.
2. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
3. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
4. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
5. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
6. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
7. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
8. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
9. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
10. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
11. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
12. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
13. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
14. We are a democratic country.
15. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
16. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
17. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
18. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
19. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
20. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
21. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
22. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
23. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
24. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
25. People get the government they deserve
26. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
27. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
28. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
29. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
30. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
33. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
34. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
35. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
36. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
37. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
38. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
41. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
42. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
43. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
44. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
45. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
46. We live in a great democracy.
47. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
48. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.","1. 11

14. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
15. We live in a great democracy.
16. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
17. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
18. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
19. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
20. I'm always cynical about government processes.
21. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
22. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
23. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
26. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
27. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
28. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
29. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
30. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
31. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
32. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
33. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
34. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
35. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
36. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
37. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
38. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
39. We are a democratic country.
40. People get the government they deserve
41. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
42. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
43. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
44. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
45. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
46. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
47. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
48. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.","1. 1

10. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

14. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
15. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.

## [Considerations]:
1. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
2. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
3. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
4. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
6. We can adapt to the coming changes.
7. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
8. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
9. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
10. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
11. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
12. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
13. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
14. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
15. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
16. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
17. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
18. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
19. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
20. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
21. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
24. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
25. I care about the planet.
26. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
29. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
30. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
31. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
32. The response to climate change is not going to be positive. The same mistakes will keep happening.

## [Considerations]:
1. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
2. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
3. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
4. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
5. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
6. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
7. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
8. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
9. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
10. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
11. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
12. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
13. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
14. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
15. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
16. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
17. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
18. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
19. I care about the planet.
20. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
21. We can adapt to the coming changes.
22. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
23. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
24. The response to climate change is not going to be positive. The same mistakes will keep happening.
25. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
26. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
27. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
28. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
29. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
30. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
31. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
32. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.

## [Considerations]:
1. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
2. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
3. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
4. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
5. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
6. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
7. I'm always cynical about government processes.
8. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
9. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
10. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
11. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
12. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
13. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
14. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
15. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
16. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
17. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
18. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
19. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
20. We are a democratic country.
21. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
22. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
23. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
24. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
25. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
26. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
27. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
28. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
29. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
30. People get the government they deserve
31. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
32. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
33. We live in a great democracy.
34. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
35. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
36. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
37. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
38. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
39. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
40. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
41. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
42. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
43. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
44. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
45. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
46. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
47. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
48. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.","1. 11

## [Considerations]:
1. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
2. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
3. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
4. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
5. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
6. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
7. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
8. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
9. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
10. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
11. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
12. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
13. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
14. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
15. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
16. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
17. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
18. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
19. People get the government they deserve
20. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
21. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
22. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
23. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
24. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
25. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
26. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
27. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
28. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
29. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
30. I'm always cynical about government processes.
31. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
32. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
33. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
34. We live in a great democracy.
35. We are a democratic country.
36. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
37. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
38. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
39. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
40. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
41. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
42. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
43. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
44. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
45. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
46. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
47. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
48. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market","1. 1

13. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
14. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
15. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.
16. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
17. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
18. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
19. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
20. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
21. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
22. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
23. There is a lot of consultation by govt – but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
24. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
25. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
26. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
27. We are a democratic country.
28. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
29. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
30. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
31. We live in a great democracy.
32. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
33. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
34. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
35. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
36. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
37. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
38. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
39. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
40. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
41. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
42. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
43. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
44. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
45. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
46. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
47. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
48. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.","1. 11
