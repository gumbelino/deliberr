Description: An implementation of deliberative reasoning index (DRI) and related 
    tools for analysis of deliberation survey data. Calculation of DRI, plot of 
    intersubjective correlations (IC), generation of large-language model (LLM)
    survey data, and permutation tests are supported. Example datasets and a
    graphical user interface (GUI) are also available to support analysis.
